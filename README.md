# Python-Libraries
Under this repository, am dealing with major pyhton libraries i.e., numpy, matplotlib and pandas
Matplotlib for plotting/data visualization
Numpy for arrays
Pandas for cleaning and exploring data sets
Remember to first intall these libraries before working with them using the following commands

pip install matplotlib

pip install pandas

pip install numpy

you can check the libraries installed using: "pip list" command
